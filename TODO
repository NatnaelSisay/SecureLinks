- Notes ordered randomly, and a new and updated not will always go to the bottom, but i need to sort them
    by the time they were updated

- on adding notes, I can't pass the header fragment, b/c the authenticated user is associated only in index.html file
and won't be accessible to other independent fragments unless they are called in the index.html file. Needs fix
